## Installation Guide

Welcome to the Laravel project! To set up and run the project locally, ensure your system meets the requirements: PHP 8.1 or higher, Composer, MySQL, Git, and a web browser.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone https://github.com/username/my-laravel-project.git` and navigate to the directory using `cd my-laravel-project`. Install dependencies by running `composer install`.

Next, set up the environment file by copying `.env.example` to `.env` using `cp .env.example .env` and edit it to configure your database: `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`, `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`, `DB_PORT=3306`, `DB_DATABASE=laravel_project`, `DB_USERNAME=root`, and `DB_PASSWORD=your_password`. 

Create an empty database in MySQL named `laravel_project`, either using MySQL Workbench or via CLI with `CREATE DATABASE laravel_project;`. Run migrations with `php artisan migrate` to create the database structure, and then seed it with initial data using `php artisan db:seed`. 

Generate the application encryption key with `php artisan key:generate`. 

Start the development server by running `php artisan serve` and open the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. 

If you encounter issues, ensure database credentials in `.env` are correct, all dependencies are installed using `composer install`, and clear the configuration cache if needed with `php artisan config:clear`. 

To run tests (if available), use `php artisan test`. 

The main directory structure includes core application files (`app/`), configuration (`config/`), migrations (`database/migrations/`), seeders (`database/seeders/`), public assets (`public/`), views and templates (`resources/`), routes (`routes/`), and storage for logs and uploads (`storage/`). 

Use the following key commands: `composer install` to install dependencies, `php artisan migrate` to create database tables, `php artisan db:seed` to seed the database, `php artisan serve` to run the application, and `php artisan config:clear` to clear the cache.
