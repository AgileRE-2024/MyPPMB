# ðŸŒŸ Laravel Project Installation Guide

Welcome to the Laravel project! Follow this guide to set up and run the application locally with ease.

Ensure your system has the following:
- âœ… **PHP** 8.1 or higher
- âœ… **Composer** (Dependency Manager)
- âœ… **MySQL** (Database Server)
- âœ… **Git** (Version Control)
- âœ… **Web Browser** (For accessing the application)

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/my-laravel-project.git
cd my-laravel-project
```
Install the required dependencies using Composer:
```bash
composer install
```
Next, configure the environment file. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` using:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then, edit the `.env` file with your database credentials:
```plaintext
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel_project
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```
Create an empty database in MySQL. Using MySQL Workbench, create a database named `laravel_project`. Alternatively, use the CLI:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE laravel_project;
```
Run the migrations to create the database tables:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
Next, seed the database with initial data:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```
Generate the application encryption key:
```bash
php artisan key:generate
```
Finally, start the Laravel development server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```
Open the application in your browser at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

If you encounter issues during setup, ensure the credentials in `.env` match your database setup, and all dependencies are installed using `composer install`. For configuration cache issues, clear it using:
```bash
php artisan config:clear
```
If tests are included in the project, run them with:
```bash
php artisan test
```

The project structure includes:
```

â”œâ”€â”€ app/                  # Core application files
